# Trasformation_imageprocessing
# Image Filtering and Transformations Analysis

This project focuses on exploring geometric transformations such as **dilation**, **translation**, **rotation**, and **reflection**. The goal is to demonstrate the distinct functionalities and use-cases of these filters and transformations in image processing.

## Technologies Used

* **OpenCV**: For image processing operations
* **NumPy**: For numerical computations
* **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the filtered and transformed images

## Transformations Overview

### 1. Dilation

* Purpose: **Enhancing object boundaries**
* Mechanism: Expands the white regions in a binary image
* Result: Useful in joining broken parts of an object

### 2. Translation

* Purpose: **Shifting the image**
* Mechanism: Moves the image in the x and y directions using a translation matrix
* Result: Changes the image position without altering its orientation

### 3. Rotation

* Purpose: **Rotating the image**
* Mechanism: Rotates the image about its center by a specified angle
* Result: Changes the image orientation while preserving shape

### 4. Reflection (Flipping)

* Purpose: **Mirroring the image**
* Mechanism: Flips the image horizontally or vertically
* Result: Creates a mirror image along the specified axis
